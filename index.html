               Hey! I'm <strong>Alex</strong>. Coding has changed my world. It's not just about apps. Learning to code gave me <i>problem-solving skills</i> and a way to communicate with others on a technical level. I can also develop websites and use my coding skills to get a better job. And I learned it all at <strong>SoloLearn</strong> where they build your self-esteem and keep you motivated. Join me in this rewarding journey. You'll have fun, get help, and learn along the way!
